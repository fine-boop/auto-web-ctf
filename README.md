# auto-web-ctf
Automate the beginning checks of any web ctf challenge 

Now this isnt an overly complicated tools, it is intended purley for timesaving purposes. Currently for it to work you must have the tools 
- Sublist3r
- gobuster
- nmap
- xsstrike
- sqlmap

installed, as well as some wordlists I will put up later. 

Of course this isnt very useful due to the amount of setting up required, but I will automate the process sometime soon.
